        <p>The abstract of the zkSafeZones whitepaer is available below:</p>
        <p>zkSafeZones introduces a pioneering approach to civilian safety in conflict zones through blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs. It extends the zkLocus framework on the Mina blockchain, innovating with an economic model centered around the $ZKL token. This model not only incentivizes the submission of geolocation data and legal evidence but also fosters a self-sustainable, decentralized legal system. By ensuring private, verifiable geolocation sharing, zkSafeZones significantly enhances civilian protection and adherence to international law. This comprehensive system integrates advanced technology for humanitarian aid, legal enforcement, and AI governance, marking a paradigm shift towards scalable, global solutions. With real-world applications aimed for integration with entities like the UN and the Red Cross, zkSafeZones aspires for widespread adoption, leveraging technology for enhanced civilian safety, legal compliance, and the creation of a decentralized ecosystem.</p>
